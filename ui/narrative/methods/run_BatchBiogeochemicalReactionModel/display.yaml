parameters :
    fba_model :
        ui-name : |
            FBA model
        short-hint : |
            FBA model
        long-hint  : |
            The FBA model that needs to be entered to drive the method. This might be the first of many.

    num_samples :
        ui-name : |
            Number of samples
        short-hint : |
            Number of samples to be randomly selected
        long-hint  : |
            The number of samples is set as 100 by default.

    max_growth :
        ui-name : |
            The maximal growth rate
        short-hint : |
            The maximal growth rate
        long-hint  : |
            The maximal growth rate is set as 1 by default.

    harvest_vol :
        ui-name : |
            The harvest volume
        short-hint : |
            The harvest volume
        long-hint  : |
            The harvest volume is set as 1 by default.

    model_type :
        ui-name : |
            Use of Cybernetic regulation
        short-hint : |
            Use of Cybernetic regulation
        long-hint  : |
            If checked, the cybernetic regulation will be applied. Otherwise, it will use the typical kinetic model.

            End time of the batch simulation
        short-hint : |
            End time of the batch simulation
        long-hint  : |
            End time of the batch simulation

    timestep :
        ui-name : |
            The number of time steps for ODE
        short-hint : |
            The number of time steps for ODE
        long-hint  : |
            The number of time steps for ODE

    random_seed :
        ui-name : |
            Random seed
        short-hint : |
            Random seed used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator
        long-hint  : |
            Random seed used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator, which is set as 41 by default.
